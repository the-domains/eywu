<article style=""><h1>Messaging and Flow</h1><p>The iOS app keeps making me think that all my posts have been sent to the trash or hasn't really been saved. I think user testing is warranted since these are experiences I'm running up against after just a few minutes of testing. Beta or no beta it's not an experience that one would launch normally given the unusually nature of some of these things. The concept is cool and I can see where the features are going but this experience is so not great that it's hard to not have immediate buyers remorse.</p></article>

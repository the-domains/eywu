Clicked on a post I created from my homepage, but ended up with a 404

Also when creating this post, I ended up with a bunch of notifications that weren't cleared. It wasn't clear why some notifications had an 'X' I could clear and why some didn't. Maybe the font size is too big on the others?

Other overlays a strange too. I think it might be due to the response times. Moving layers up and down isn't intuitive and I for some reason keep clicking on the delete button as the context menu pops up.

It's also curious why sometimes the photo is injected above a content block and sometimes below. 

I know I'm being fairly critical and really don't have malicious intent of bashing. $100 experiment +

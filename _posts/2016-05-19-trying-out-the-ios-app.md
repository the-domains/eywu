description: "Seems a bit buggy. Clicking on Upload Cover Photo doesn't do a thing even after granting access to the photo roll. I can't even press the enter button so all the sentences are in one block. There also doesn't seem to be a save or what not. I guess it auto saves but that's not clear. When I click back it just gives me a blank screen. I think there's a bit of a lag. Even worse is I'm typing but can't see what I'm typing because the page doesn't auto scroll up. Feels like many features were put together but not a whole lot of real world testing. Even for a beta app I'd expect a bit of polish or testing. It's also weird that all the editing tools are below the fold. So strange. Hmm i uploaded a photo but not sure where that one went. It's not visible anywhere."

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Florida court allows Google to be sued by publisher delisted as "pure spam"</h1><p>Courts in the US have consistently held that search engines have almost total discretion over the content on their pages and ranking algorithms under the First Amendment of the US Constitution. This is a legal defense against companies bringing claims about the economic impact of ranking changes or Google's SEO-related policies.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/c144c68e5875782ce5e6d5644551844474edce0a.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Google App Indexing Replaced By Firebase App Indexing</h1><p>Today is Google I/O and I am spotting a some changes to the Google docs that have not yet been announced.

It probably wouldn't be the Silicon Valley super unicorn that it is today.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Florida court allows Google to be sued by publisher delisted as "pure spam"</h1><p>Courts in the US have consistently held that search engines have almost total discretion over the content on their pages and ranking algorithms under the First Amendment of the US Constitution.
